# Application and Workshop Fees

## Application 

To apply, please complete the application form [here](https://goo.gl/forms/a5LP7YX0VwlCLBID3). **The application deadline is 11:59pm Sunday, January 21, 2018.** All applicants will be notified on Monday, February 12.

To keep the workshop as personal as possible, we are limiting participation to 36 attendees. Each application will be reviewed by the instructor team, and we will select 36 students who will be offered a place on the course. There will be a waitlist in the event a selected student cancels and a place on the course opens up.

In reviewing the applications, we will be looking for:
  * Familiarity with the MinION platform - maybe you’ve run one, maybe you’ve analysed data from someone else’s MinION run, maybe your lab has just purchased one
  * Basic proficiency on the command line - you will need to be comfortable working with files in a Unix/Linux environment
  * Enthusiasm about using the MinION in future projects
  
We also expect students to attend all five days of the course, and to be able to pay the workshop fees within two weeks of being accepted to PoreCamp.

Places will be offered based on merit, but amongst equally qualified candidates, preference will be given to UBC-affiliated candidates, including students, faculty, and staff based at a BC health care agency.

The 36 successful students will be offered places on the course and the remaining applicants will be assigned a waitlist number. **Accepted applicants must confirm their registration and pay the workshop fee by noon, Wednesday February 28** or else their place will be offered to someone on the waitlist. Cancellations will open places to waitlisted students; the waitlist will be kept active until Friday, May 4.

## Workshop Fees
The workshop fee is $1500CAD. PoreCamp runs on a break-even basis and we’ve calculated the workshop fee so as to cover our major expenses. For transparency purposes, the bulk of the workshop revenue - 60% - covers costs related to instruction (flights, accommodation, meal per diems, and a small honorarium for our instructors, all of whom are taking time away from their families and their laboratories to run the course), while 30% covers the costs of the MinION flow cells and reagents, and 10% covers hospitality expenses (the opening reception, coffee breaks, and the Aquarium sequencing field trip and closing dinner). Please note that we cannot provide tuition receipts for income tax purposes. 

Cancellations before 11:59pm on April 9 will receive a 50% refund of their workshop fee. Cancellations from April 10 onwards will forfeit the workshop fee.
